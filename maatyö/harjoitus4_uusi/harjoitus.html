<p>
    Vex, also known as The Gloomist, is a villainous playable character in the multiplayer online battle 
    arena game League of Legends. She made her debut in the Rise of the Sentinels event as an antagonist.
</p>

<p>
    She is a gloomy emo yordle from Bandle City, whom hates happiness and color. After travelling to the Shadow Isles, she met the Ruined King and 
    took a fancy to him, being the one who amplified his control over the Black Mist in the first place so she can spread misery all over Runeterra.
</p>

<p>Set to be the one-hundred and fifty-seventh champion added to the game, Vex will be played in the middle lane.</p>

<h3>THE GLOOMIST</h3>

<p>
    In the black heart of the Shadow Isles Crest icon.png Shadow Isles, a lone yordle 
    trudges through the spectral fog, content in its murky misery. 
    With an endless supply of malaise and a powerful shadow in tow, Vex shields herself from the 
    pep and happiness of the outside world, and all of the irksome 'normies' who occupy it.
</p>
<p>
    Growing up in Bandle City Crest icon.png Bandle City, Vex never felt she belonged. The whimsy 
    and color of the yordle realm was cloying to her. Despite the best efforts of her parents, she 
    never seemed to find her 'yordle spirit' or any like-minded friends, and 
    chose to spend most of her time sulking in her room.
</p>
<p>
    There, she found an unlikely soulmate in her own shadow. It was black (her favorite color), 
    and it didn’t talk—the perfect companion for the sullen youth. She learned to entertain 
    herself with the shadow, performing gloomy pantomimes for her own amusement.
</p>
<p>
    Alas, it was just a shadow, incapable of shielding Vex from the loathsome cheerfulness 
    that surrounded her. Surely something more lay in store. Something darker. Something sad. Something just like her.
</p>
<p>
    That something arrived in the form of a Harrowing, thick clouds of Black Mist that billowed through 
    Bandle City, stirring its residents to panic. While most yordles fought valiantly to beat back the Mist, 
    Vex was intrigued by the foul miasma and began to follow it to its source.
</p>
<p>
    When she arrived in the Shadow Isles, Vex couldn’t believe her eyes. Vast tracts of land and sea, 
    devoid of all life and color, stretched out before her. Here, she could finally sulk, unbothered by the laughter and merriment of others.
</p>
<p>
    As the days passed, Vex realized the Black Mist was having a strange effect on her. Her shadow shadow had taken on a new ghostly 
    persona—much more lively and expressive than its host—and her benign yordle magic had transformed 
    into something far more sinister. Vex could now spread her misery far and wide.
</p>
<p>
    'Who made this wonderfully awful place?'' she wondered.
</p>
<p>
    Her question was soon answered when the Ruined King, Viego Viego, appeared in the Isles, seeking to spread his Mist to all corners of Runeterra. Upon 
    meeting Vex, Viego realized the yordle had a unique ability to spread despair, making people more vulnerable to his Harrowing. Vex, in turn, 
    was inspired by his vision for a world covered in Black Mist. The two became fast allies and set out to turn the entire world into a harrowed wasteland.
</p>
<p>
    Before Viego’s vision could be fully realized, Vex discovered his ulterior motive: to reclaim the soul of his dead queen Isolde, 
    and reunite with her in matrimonial bliss. She shuddered in disgust, feeling betrayed that the man she had trusted to kill the world’s 
    happiness had, in fact, been seeking it himself. Vex left Viego to be defeated by the Sentinels of Light, his dreams of a ruined world 
    dashed upon the stones of the Camavoran wreckage. Alone once more, she watched in disappointment as the world returned to the bright, 
    colorful place she had always hated. Finding a lasting melancholy was going to be tougher than she’d thought.
</p>
<p>
    She knew one last place she could go—a surefire way to achieve the misery she craved. She paid a
